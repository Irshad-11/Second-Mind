### What is Second Mind?

**Second Mind** is a personalized learning management system designed by [me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/irshad-hossain-785548323/), for students. It's a single, cohesive solution to a common problem: the chaotic conflict between your academic syllabus and the essential skills you need to learn on your own (like web development, DSA, and side projects).

Forget juggling multiple apps and notebooks. Second Mind is your personal command center where you can manage your classes, plan for exams, take notes, and organize your self-planningâ€”all in one place. It's not just a tool; it's a second brain built to sync up your entire academic journey.



### The Problem Second Mind Solves

As a student, your academic life and personal skill development often feel like two separate worlds. Your university classes follow one path, while your self-learning, crucial for career growth, follows another. This creates a messy, disorganized, and overwhelming experience.

Second Mind fixes this by providing a unified workspace to manage:
* **Class Notes:** A dedicated space to write daily notes for your academic courses.
* **Exam Planning:** A focused tab to plan and prepare for upcoming exams.
* **A "Dumping Ground":** A digital canvas to quickly save interesting links, files, text, images, and random ideas without worrying about organization.
* **Routines & Plans:** An "Info" tab to outline and track your weekly routines and study plans.


### Key Features and Unique Selling Points

Second Mind stands out because it's not trying to be an overwhelming, one-size-fits-all solution. It's a personalized tool that gives you complete control.

* **Tailored, Not Overwhelming:** Unlike complex LMS platforms, Second Mind is focused on solving a specific, personal problem in a straightforward way.
* **Your Data, Your Control:** The system uses **IndexedDB** to store your data locally on your browser.
* **JSON Import/Export:** This is a crucial feature. You can easily export your data as a JSON file and import it on another browser or device, ensuring you never lose your progress. Your workstation is ready exactly as you left it.
* **Clean and Intuitive UI:** Built with **React** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**, the interface is designed to be clean, fast, and easy to use.
* **Personalized Solutions:** This project is my solution, but if you're interested in a custom, personalized version tailored to your specific needs, please contact me.


### Technical Details

* **Frontend:** React JS
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **State Management:** Local storage with IndexedDB
* **Animation:** Framer Motion
* **Icons:** React Icons
* **Deployment:** Vercel (Free Hosting)
* **Other Libraries:** EmailJS and other supporting libraries



### Getting Started

Upon your first visit, a quick tutorial will guide you through the core features. This ensures you understand how to utilize Second Mind to its full potential and get the most out of your personalized workstation.



### Future Roadmap ![v1.2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-v1.2.0-blue)

I'm committed to continuously improving Second Mind based on user feedback. Here are some of the planned updates and features for version 1.2.0:

* **Improved Keyboard Navigation:** We'll be adding a more intuitive system for navigating between the breadcrumbs and bullet items, allowing for a faster, more fluid workflow. The item naming will also be changed to simply "+ Add Item" for better clarity.

* **Routine Integration:** A new button will be added to the top-right corner of the Class and Exam tabs. This will give you quick access to your weekly routines and study schedules without having to leave your current task.

* **Ongoing Improvements:** Other updates and enhancements will be released over time, with a focus on improving performance, user experience, and stability based on the feedback I receive.
